### Group Members - 

1. Roopam Jain

3. Priyadarshini Kumari
4. Dhananjay Singh
5. Arhum Khan


### Objective -

The product could be a replacement for the existing system where an individual needs to make manual efforts for finding people who need books or people who need to donate books. It could also be beneficial for the NGOâ€™s where they can easily get in touch with people who want to share a helping hand and also it would be easy for them to reach out to the people who really need help. The product is an advantage to the educational system as books can be reused at a larger scale and also it would help in saving the environment as millions of trees are cut to get paper every year.
